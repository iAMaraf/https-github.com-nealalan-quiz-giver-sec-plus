1. C. The administrator should ensure systems are not susceptible to unauthorized changes, an element of integrity. A security program should address the three core security principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability; the system in the example is already addressing confidentiality and availability. Protecting data and securing data to prevent unauthorized disclosure addresses confidentiality. Ensuring critical systems provide uninterrupted service addresses availability. See Chapter 1.
2. B. You can maintain confidentiality of any data, including Personally Identifiable Information (Pll) with encryption. Hashes provide integrity, not confidentiality. A digital signature provides authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity. A redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) provides higher availability for a disk subsystem. See Chapters 1 and 10.
3. B. She is pursuing integrity by verifying the configuration files have not changed. By verifying that the hashes are the same, she also verifies that the configuration files are the same. Confidentiality is enforced with encryption, access controls, and steganography. Availability ensures systems are up and operational when needed. Safety goals help ensure the safety of personnel and/or other assets. See Chapters 1 and 10.
4. B. Layered security (or defense in depth) implements multiple controls to provide several layers of protection. In this case, the antivirus software provides one layer of protection while the firewall and the intrusion detection system (IDS) provide additional layers. Implicit deny blocks access unless it has been explicitly allowed. Least privilege ensures that users are granted only the access they need to perform their jobs, and no more. A flood guard attempts to block SYN flood attacks. See Chapter 1.
5. D. In this scenario, it's best to create a temporary password that expires after first use, which forces the user to create a new password. It's not necessary to verify the user's account exists, but the help-desk professional should verify the identity of the user. Passwords should not be available in such a way that allows help-desk professionals to look them up. It is not necessary to disable a user account to reset the password. See Chapter 1.
6. D. A hardware token (such as an RSA token) uses a one-time password for authentication in the something you have factor of authentication. Biometric methods are in the something you are factor of authentication, such as a fingerprint. A PIN and a password are both in the something you know factor of authentication and do not require a hardware token. See Chapter 1.
7. C A retina scan is a biometric method of authentication in the something you are factor of authentication. You need to combine two or more factors of authentication for dual-factor and multifactor authentication. A Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) is a protocol used to create passwords that expire after 30 seconds. See Chapter 1.
8. B. Users authenticate with two factors of authentication in this scenario, which is multifactor authentication or dual-factor authentication. The smart card is in the something you have factor of authentication, and the PIN is in the something you know factor of authentication. They are using more than a single factor. Mutual authentication is when both entities in the authentication process authenticate with each other, but it doesn't apply in this situation. A Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) is a protocol used to create passwords that expire after 30 seconds. See Chapter 1.
9. B. Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) protocol and is the best choice. TACACS+ is proprietary to Cisco, so it won't support different vendor solutions. Diameter is preferable to RADIUS, but there is no such thing as a Circumference protocol. SAML is an SSO solution used with web-based applications. See Chapter 1.
10. C This describes a single sign-on (SSO) solution in which users only have to log on once. Same sign-on indicates users can access multiple systems using the same credentials, but they still have to enter their credentials again each time they access a new resource. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an SSO solution used for web-based applications, but not all SSO solutions are using SAML. Biometrics is a method of authentication, such as a fingerprint, but it isn't an SSO solution. See Chapter 1.
